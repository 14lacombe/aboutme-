		<h1>Hello!</h1>

			<h2>Nice to meet you, I'm Juliette.</h2>

				<h3>Here's a little bit about me</h3>

					<p>I'm originally from the Detroit area and am the middle of three daughters. I went to college in D.C. and then moved to Chicago post grad. My older sister lives in Manhattan and my younger sister goes to school in Northern California. We are truly coast to coast and in between-- it gives my parents lots of great places to visit. My family loves to travel apart or together and we've been all over the world. Check out a list below of some of my favorite places.</p>


						<ul>
							<li>Grenada, Spain</li>
							<li>Paris, France</li>
							<li>Busan, South Korea</li>
							<li>Florence, Italy</li>
							<li>Banff, Canada</li>
						</ul>

							<h4>I hope to make a trip abroad in the next year/year and a half and want to explore a new continent. Stay tuned!</h4>
